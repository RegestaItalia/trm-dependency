This is an example package made to test how TRM handles dependencies with packages.

If you also want to test how dependencies are handled, try installing [trm-dependant](https://github.com/RegestaItalia/trm-dependant), a package that uses one (or more) objects from this package.

Full explaination of how packages should be installed on your system is [here](https://docs.trmregistry.com/#/client/docs/examples/installHelloWorld).
